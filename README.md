# Weather Forecast with NeuralProphet 🌤️

Welcome to the Weather Forecast with NeuralProphet project repository. This project aims to forecast the minimum and maximum temperatures for five different cities in Egypt using historical weather data obtained from Open-Meteo.

## Objective 

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically NeuralProphet, to accurately forecast weather conditions for the selected cities in Egypt based on historical weather data.

## Dataset 

The historical weather dataset is sourced from [Open-Meteo's Historical Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api). This dataset includes weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, collected over time for each city.

## Cities Included

The forecast will be generated for the following cities in Egypt:

- Cairo
- Alexandria
- Luxor
- Aswan
- Sharm El Sheikh

## NeuralProphet Model 

NeuralProphet is a forecasting library built on top of PyTorch, designed to handle time series data with ease. In this project, NeuralProphet will be used to train and evaluate models for weather forecasting.
